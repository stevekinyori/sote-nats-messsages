# Messages
This is where the request and reply json structures are stored.  The request is the person asking for information or an action. The reply, if neeeded, is the result from the request.  

This is also referred to as the Message Contract between two parties where Sote is at least one of those parties.

## Directory Name and structures
The name of the directory must be the message subject node names. **There must be two Sub-directories below the parent directory called reply and request.** The directory, sub-directories, and filename must follow the standard approach in the [NATS Configuration worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ASFY_WN5DK2E0Sjb8vRHviyspl-c5EDL2sasi94edwg/edit?usp=sharing).
